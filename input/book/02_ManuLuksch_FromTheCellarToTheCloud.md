Autonomous Archiving 
=====================

\#OccupyGezi: This is just the beginning!
-----------------------------------------

On 27-28 May 2013, Taksim Solidarity Platform announced a protest
against the demolition of the north part of Gezi Park in realization of
the Istanbul Greater Municipality’s Taksim Pedestrian Project. The
protest which was initiated by a small group, expanded into a much
larger, mass action. The harsh intervention of the police on 29-30 May
lead to an increase in the number of protesters. Following the conflict
in the streets on 30-31 May, hundreds of thousands of people went to
Taksim Square and started to protect Gezi Park. This soon spread to
other cities in Turkey; the focus of the mass protest became a fight for
rights and democracy. Since 2012, there was a public debate about Taksim
Square Project that was initiated by *Istanbul Greater Municipality*
which has an upside down form that both public and professionals from
Chamber of Architects and Chamber of Urban Planners were against. This
is another form of public space project initiated by governmental
organizations which was aiming to have a cleaned, controled, high
surveillant space; including the building of a replica 19th century
Ottoman barracks, ‘Topçu Kışlası’, and said by the Prime Minister to
include the construction of a shopping centre and mosque. Project was
designed without any participatory practices and asking civil society
organizations and chambers. As soon as the project was announced to the
public, Taksim Solidarity Platform\[1\], combining civil society
organizations, chambers, independent political groups, collectives and
individuals under its umbrella, initiated public protests, petitions,
events and a festival in Gezi Park in the following months to create a
public opinion on the defence of public spaces that should be protected
as cultural heritages of the city.

But there was an intense moment when the bulldozers started breaking
down the walls and taking down the trees in Gezi Park. Due to
incompliance of the demolishment with the signed development plan,
civilians occupied the park to protest the construction. Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's statement, ‘No matter what you do, we gave our
final decision about Gezi Park’ provoked more people to join the
protest.\[2\] Protesters started occupying the park day and night in
their tents. With the spread of the news, Turkish artists started
supporting the protest as well.

Around 05:00 in the morning on the second day of occupation, police
forces raided the park with tear gas and started burning protester's
tents without any warning. Consequently, construction vehicles proceeded
to the area. The parliamentary Sırrı Süreyya Önder stood against the
bulldozers and stopped the construction. Attitude of the police forces
was the breaking point of the protest, which excessively increased the
number of the protesters. On the next day in early morning, police
attacked for a second time to the protesters. After dispersing the
crowd, police started to cover the park with barriers, which eventually
increased the tension of the clash further to streets. Conflict kept
rising up until the early hours of the morning. The violent attitude of
the police forces caused thousands of other people around Turkey to join
the protest. The whole public somehow affiliated themselves with
different kind of problems related to authoritarian government and
totally the whole protests became a struggle for human rights and
democracy in public space in any sense. 3.5 million people took active
part in almost 5,000 demonstrations across Turkey.

Videoccupy: all efforts are for ‘I see’
---------------------------------------

On the day of 2 June Videoccupy media activist collective was initiated
by a group of people having diverse backgrounds aimed to record the
whole process in the context of mapping the visual memory and creating
an open source digital media archive of Gezi resistance. Members of the
collective also aimed to create their own media by showing police
violence towards protestors who were using their democratic rights
though they were shown on Turkish mainstream media as they are totally
offensive, unfair, looter and predatory. However police frequently fired
plastic bullets directly at protesters’ heads and upper bodies. Tear gas
canisters were routinely fired directly at protestors, bystanders and
sometimes into residential buildings and medical facilities, resulting
in hundreds of injuries. Chemical irritants were added to water cannon
supply tanks. Women protesters were sexually abused by law enforcement
officials. Live ammunition was used. Eleven people were killed and more
than 8,000 were injured at the demonstrations across Turkey.

height="3.5395833333333333in"}

Videoccupy aimed to visualize the peaceful intent of the resistance
movement to open the public spaces in the city to public. Collective
members recorded everyday life of Gezi Park from the very first day it
was occupied by the citizens until police attacked the park, burned the
tents, fired gas and kicked people off by using brutality on 15 June.
Videoccupy also aimed to collect visual data from the protestors who
were recording with their cell phones, ipad or video/photo cameras.
Members of the collective made a call to the protestors on the first
days of park occupation and collected data under the tent of a pioneer
political activist collective called Our Commons. The call was made on 4
June by the collective members:

> ‘On 2 June we initiated a video collective Videoccupy. We aim to
> record the visual memory and archiving the resistance process since
> 27^th^ of May 2013. It collects recordings done with devices as ipad,
> phones and video camera. The whole collected material will be archived

> videograms that we do produce, multiply and share exist in between

> the manipulated mainstream media and against the authoritative gaze of

> to [our](mailto:videoccupy@gmail.com) email address. In order to make
> it easy the organization of the archive, please do file your moving
> images as name/space/day/hour/event’.\[3\]

A lot of activists became aware of the importance of visual recording of
such an important moment, and to be able to witness what is happening
and what unfair act has been inflicted by the government towards
protestors. They were very much interested in recording the every day
life of park; people sharing the common space, creating different kind
of solidarity practices, and certainly different visual languages and
also disseminating these visual languages. As no one knew when and where
the protests, occupation and resistance would end, collective members
realized the importance of interviewing the people to figure out which
kind of people were visiting the park and who was taking part in the
resistance. Interviews focused on their contribution to the process,
what they are thinking about that, their imagination of society,
democracy, formation of citizenship and also public space they are
dreaming of. Collective members also interviewed with some leading
persons and important figures of the protests. For instance the director
of Chamber of Architects, the parliamenters who were contributing,
supporting the protests, and lawyers, leading persons of political
parties and activist groups about their point of views on the whole
resistance process in the framework of urban rights, democracy and
emancipation, appropriation of public space, and effects of recent
social movements to Gezi resistance.

Afterwards the collective started to bring all this data together by
organizing the tasks and exchanging the voluntary labor among its
members, and shared the whole recordings; interviews, happenings,
violence, everyday life act, visual languages, different protest types,
transformation of public space, namely the whole process with the
public. After the eviction of the park, Videoccupy kept recording
various forms of protests that proceeded in the following process; like
many park forums, disobedience acts, press releases of different NGOs,
mass gatherings and marches to stand against the brutality and human
rights violations committed by the police.

In terms of visual production, Videoccupy was not interested in
documentary, it was more that seeing actions, recording at that moment
and directly presenting what was seen and what was recorded. Therefore
being very careful with editing anything to bring a ‘naked’ visual
material for the audience. Trying to form and be part of a collective
identity is all about that effort. For the collective members, the
camera is not a tool, the camera is part of the body which moves with
the body and takes part in the event directly. The camera is not
considered as a tool for recording from outside, it is there in the
happening, taking part bodily all with the eyes, taking place in the
event. And video activist tactics are based on collective imaginary and
based on collective image recording.

The aim was to create an archive, a public online digital archive with
recording of more than two thousand hours which was divided into dates,
places, types of protests and topics. The aim of the archive was to be
participatory, interactive, expanding and lively. The act of archiving
the visual data is crucial in order to keep the visual collective memory
alive.

Collective Memory 
------------------

In many ways Gezi Park Protests was an unprecedented social uprising,
not only by the heterogeneity of the protesters and actors involved, and
their ways of acting, collaboration and solidarity created, but also by
the extensive use of all kinds of new media tools that led to a
proliferation of audio visual and written materials produced and shared
in social media platforms. In a process where, what is happening on the
streets had no exposure in mass media at all or it is completely
manipulated or distorted, to think about and investigate on the
questions of collective memory becomes both indispensible and vital. At
this point, a digital media archive as a tool of collective memory is a
*milieu de mémoire* which gathers what is to be otherwise forgotten,
distorted or intentionally erased from the social memory. It also allows
questioning what is visible and hidden and creates a space of collective
investigation and creation based on the material available.

Within the wider scope of an online digital media archive platform,
focusing on social and political movements in Turkey, it was meaningful
to start with Videoccupy’s video archive of Gezi and immediately create
an open access online visual memory platform just after the protests.
[*https://bak.ma*](https://bak.ma/) emerged from these discussions. The
social and political agenda has always been very lively and protests
against any forms of authoritarian governance and repression has been
going on in different ways and forms, bak.ma could carry the potential
to establish connections between the past, the recent past and also in
the future, both with regards to the earlier and upcoming movements. The
significance of this archive stems from its potential to be a
resourceful platform and a space of memory, which paved the way for new
ways of thinking through the visual material.

Normal citizens get lost!
-------------------------

Moving away from traditional state archives and their authoritarian
methods, bak.ma is an attempt to create new means for archiving images.
In Turkish the word ‘bakma’ means ‘don't look’, and the name ‘bak.ma’ is
also inspired by a quote in an article written by Cypriot thinker S.
Ulus Baker. Baker discusses ‘seeing’ as an emancipatory act, and he
choses a very specific moment, which happened in 1995 during the
protests against F-type, prisons in Ankara:

> “‘Normal Citizens Get Lost”... an announcement by the police could be
> heard in the centre of Ankara. Citizens whom are not “normal” should
> probably the ones who were to be surrounded by the police band and the
> tanks ready to spray water. The state’s desire is definitely to make
> them “disappear” (this doesn’t need a special ability) and disperse as
> soon as possible. However, for the first time, we are learning through
> a police announcement to “normal” citizens that people must be “get
> lost”, “scattered”, so they suddenly disappear from the busiest
> squares and streets in the city. “Don’t look!”. Another police
> announcement, just like “Get lost!” command, ring in the ears...
> “Don’t look!”, this command shows a distinction between “to look” and
> “to see” a special talent of human beings... It is as if human beings
> truly had a talent to see everything, with countless eyes (like the
> bees) as if they were not looking and it is inevitable...’ (Baker
> 1996).

As such, bak.ma is about looking: looking in different ways and from
different perspectives. One year after Gezi, bak.ma digital media
archive of social movements was accessible after long discussions on the
collected visual data. It can be seen as an autonomous archival
initiative.

The term autonomous archive refers to Lawrence Liang, legal researcher,
lawyer and member from Pad.ma\[4\], and he argued, ‘as a particular
form, state archives do not exhaust the concept of the archive’. He
continued that

> ‘the task of creating an archive is neither to replicate nor to mimic
> state archives but to creatively produce a concept of the archive. An
> archive actively creates new ways of thinking about how we access our
> individual and collective experiences. Autonomous archives do not just
> supplement what is missing in state archives; they also render what is
> present, unstable’ (Liang 2016).

In her article ‘On the Necropolitics - Decolonizing Archiving’, Pelin
Tan asserts that the characteristics of an autonomous and decolonized
archival structure can be seen in its collective assemblage of
production (editing, recording, montage) and its shifting representation
in different political genres and via display. As she argues:

> ‘If we look at the discourse and definition of the contemporary
> meaning of “decolonization” in the context of a regime of image
> discourse and politics, the term is more complex and beyond the
> dualistic structure of colonizer/colonized and formation of
> subjectivities. Techno-politics based infrastructural colonization is
> more complex where extra statecraft is involved. Thus, discussing the
> practice of decolonization is already a confusing concept. How
> moving-image archives are utilized and how they function in a process
> of decolonization not only regards the sharing and use of open-source
> digital tools. It’s also about the storage and management of a
> database of continuous demonstrations, actions of resistance and civil
> struggles’ (Pelin 2016).

In this context, according to Tan, the structure of bak.ma needs to be
understood in the frame of necropolitical decolonization, which is
through the image itself. Video footages on bak.ma provide the residuals
of each of the subjectivities that create everyday assemblages.

As Liang claimed that the state archives cannot define the archive,
since they are just a form of archives, therefore they do not exhaust
the concept of the archive. And as he says,

> ‘Autonomous archival initiatives are often a response to the
> monopolization of public memory by the state, and the political
> effects that flow from such mnemonic power. But attempts to create
> autonomous archives do not necessarily supplement the memory machine
> of the state’ (Liang 2016).

As an autonomous archival practise, bak.ma should not be considered as a
storage space or a database of preserving images. As Liang affirms:

> ‘Contemporary archival impulses attempt to realize the potential of
> the archive as virtuality, and challenge us to think through the
> productive capacities of an archive beyond the blackmail of memory and
> amnesia. The production of a concept is a provocation, a refusal to
> answer to the call of the known, and an opportunity to intensify our
> experiences. The archive is therefore not representational; it is
> creative. The naming of something as an archive is not the end, but
> the beginning of a debate’ (Liang 2016).

Autonomous archives consist in several media, and since they are mostly
based on free softwares, they motivate their users to be active and
productive. Thus these archival practices are completely opposite to the
state archives. The archives mostly emerged in conflicted areas. For
example, in Ukraine, while former president Viktor Yanukovych was
fleeing the country on a boat in 2014, a group of journalists, writers
and activists rescued 23.776 secret documents that were thrown in the
lake by Yanukovych family. For two years now these ‘secret’ documents
are available on yanukovychleaks.org, while the physical copies are
preserved in a collective space. Other examples can be found in, for
example, Syria and Egypt, such as the Syrian Archive, the Tahrir
archives by Mosireen Collective and the filmingrevolution.org initiated
by Alisa Lebow, which is described as a meta-documentary about
documentary and independent filmmaking in Egypt. Since the revolution,
it brought together the collective wisdom and creative strategies of
media-makers in Egypt. The archive consists of edited video materials
and testimonies of video activists. Members of Mosireen came together in
Tahrir and produced several testimonal videos, documenting the uprising
in Egypt for three years. They shared their about 250 and partly edited
videos on their Youtube channel, the ‘Mosireen Archive’, which was
selected the most viewed Youtube channel in January 2012.\[5\] As Basia
Lewandowska Cummings stated:

> ‘A public survey from a year earlier reported that 84 percent of
> Egyptians relied on state-owned TV for their news, Mosireen’s digital
> ubiquity was a major coup. The battle for images and the narratives
> they afforded raged during the revolution. Mosireen were fearlessly
> creating a democratic, open-access image archive that bore witness to
> it all’ (Cummings 2013).

During the same years in Syria many activists were on the streets
documenting the clashes, bomb attacks, and their own deaths. As Ali
Shamseddine and John Rich say

> ‘A torrent of images of Syrian heroics, deaths, conversations, and
> screams flooded the web as soon as the revolution broke out. These new
> Syrian diaries were formed by digital images and videos of the
> everyday. Syrians diligently used social media (blogs, articles, and
> forum entries), unleashing massive amounts of information documenting
> events and ascertaining facts. All of this has been archived on the
> web for circulation and use’ (Shamseddine and Rich 2014).

The Syrian Archive\[6\] was initiated by Syrian human rights
organizations, media activists, journalists and lawyers. Licensed under
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0), they clarify
the mission of the archive as a shared archive to preserve material
relating to human rights violations. In the archive all the violations
in Syria are listed and mapped town by town and most of them are
documented. This practice could be seen as a survival tool or tactic, to
which Shamseddine and Rich reply,

> ‘\[The Syrians are\] desperately archiving their individual dying.
> Blood flows for cameras to see. Maybe Syrians know deep down that
> counting their dead won’t grant them immediate or near-term
> emancipation. Documentation needs a sense of finality to be regarded
> as a document. It is not enough for 200,000 or 300,000 people to die.
> The survival of a few Syrians casts doubt on the validity of the
> document. With such doubt, Syrians try even harder to internationalize
> their struggle and to reach with their bloodshed those who are
> powerless to stop it’ (Shamseddine and Rich 2014).

They continue that the intensity and amount of deaths are not the
material but the purpose of the Syrian archive. Therefore, this new
archive is not on the effects of life and facts but it is on the ongoing
deaths, as they mention,

> In the case of Syria, there are many documents: pictures, videos,
> names, stories, and rumors of death and torture. Each victim has a
> name and a body, a face and a life story that is part of the countless
> entries in the archive. It’s possible to imagine that such an enormous
> archive could turn the blood of Syrian’s into water (Shamseddine and
> Rich 2014).

Digital space is the public space
---------------------------------

Urban space is not anymore where we are dwelling and working; it is the
space where the social and political are constantly reproduced. Urban
justice movements are becoming more vital than ever in cities and
conflicted geographies where any citizen can participate in/through
different actions with several abilities in their everyday life.
Recently, we are living in a technological and digital age that image
making and moving image editing are not only accessible by any citizen
but also have potentialities for claiming the future imagination on
social and political co-existences. Ipads, iphones, handy cheap digital
HD cameras enable us to become part of the ‘event’ where social and
political rupture happens in our society and cities.

In this context, bak.ma aims to reveal the recent history of Turkey with
audio-visual recordings, documents and testimonies. The content of the
archive is extending to include and involve visual data of other social
movements such as TEKEL (tobacco) workers resistance in 2009-2010, May
days, workers marches from 1977 until now, feminist and lgbti movements,
ecology movement, and specific demonstrations, events, meetings, talks,
interviews, etc.

The platform is open for everyone to use and by using the software
program pan/do.ra, bak.ma has a special categorization that can be
organized by topics, dates, names, time of the day or places to be
controlled by any of its members.

![](.src/media/image6.png){width="6.292361111111111in"
height="3.1618055555555555in"}

Members can also edit videos online, besides downloading and uploading
videos, giving tags and annotations. bak.ma does not only aim to contain
Gezi upheaval’s videos but also several other videograms that were
stored in hidden part of computers by media activists. Pan.do/ra is a
free and open source program. The data (depending on its size especially
for massive uploads) is classified by dates and topics and can be
transferred to a computer running Linux. The whole process is based on
collective working principles. Collective documentation and montage
requires working collaboratively to produce alternative economic
organizations and spaces in place. According to Tan, the ‘collective’
does not suggest the massing together of alike subjects, nor should the
term ‘action’ imply an efficacy that originates in intentional beings or
that is distinct from thought.

> ‘In short, collective action requires the ethics of a community
> economy. I fact, I would articulate this more as an act of ethics of
> locality that meets the needs suggested by our everyday knowledge and
> the experience of safeguarding our livelihoods in urban spaces. The
> relational network established as a result is more of an instant
> community that chooses to think and discuss together rather than a
> normative structure. Self-organization is not a simple hierarchy based
> on certain labor activities and their division but, conversely, a
> work/labor structure that allows one to be a farmer in the morning and
> a graphic designer in the afternoon’ (Tan 2014: 17).

In the process of building the archive, everyone involved in the
collective structure has been discussing archiving practices and urban
movements, collecting visual data, videograms of civil disobedience and
the possibility of editing the revolution in a metaphoric sense. This is
to say that we believe that the term ‘archiving’ in digital video
production and dissemination does not only mean an open source memory
making of hidden and disobedient practices, but it also provides an
autonomous structure that leads to collective montage, uploading,
leaking images and re-building a collective memory of political
disobedience. bak.ma invites users and guests to dive into its deep and
wavy video ocean.
